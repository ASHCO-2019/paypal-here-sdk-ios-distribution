iOS frameworks to your project that the SDK relies on.

This includes 

AudioToolbox.framework
MobileCoreServices.framework
Security.framework
CFNetwork.framework
AVFoundation.framework
ExternalAccessory.framework
MediaPlayer.framework
CoreTelephony.framework
Foundation.framework 

Compilation flags:
Note that, depeneding on your xcode version, base SDK choice, and if you have any .mm files
in your project, you may also need these flags in your project's 'Other Linker Flags':
-lstdc++
-stdlib=libstdc++
