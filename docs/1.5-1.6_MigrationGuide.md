PPHSDK 1.5.x - 1.6 Migration Guide

Overview
========
Version 1.6 of the PayPalHere SDk introduces several large features and improvements, namely the capability to take EMV payments. To facilitate this functionality many APIs have been changed, added or removed. The intent of this document is to raise awareness of those changes and what the replacements or recommendations are.


Transaction Manager
=========
`PPHTransactionManager` contains the most changes. There are several new APIs to support EMV payments though. Although the previous non-UI payments interfaces are mostly unchanged, PayPal **strongly** recommends you adopt the new UI payment methods for *all* card present transactions. These methods provide more consistent and user friendly interfaces and will enable PayPal to better support your integration.

Here we will compare a basic view controller that interacts with the non-UI swipe payment APIs and one that interacts with the rich UI payments APIs.

To use the non-UI payment methods in `PPHTransactionManager` you must do these steps:

1. Allocate a `PPHTransactionWatcher`
2. Implement the delegate methods in `PPHTransactionManagerDelegate`
3. Respond to the events passed in `onPaymentEvent:`
4. Display UI and collect information from the user such as signature or receipt destination
5. Call the appropriate `PPHTransactionManager` methods to send the data

Here is a simple example of the above steps that processes a magstripe payment:

```objc
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
@interface MyTransactionViewController () <
PPHTransactionManagerDelegate
>

@property (nonatomic, strong) PPHTransactionWatcher *transactionWatcher;

@end

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
@implementation MyTransactionViewController

-(instancetype)init {
    if (self = [super init]) {
        self.transactionWatcher = [[PPHTransactionWatcher alloc] initWithDelegate:self];
    }
    
    return self;
}

- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewDidAppear:animated];
    
    PPHInvoice *sampleInvoice = [[PPHInvoice alloc] initWithItem:@"Falcon Punch!" forAmount:[PPHAmount amountWithString:@"1.00"]];
    [[PayPalHereSDK sharedTransactionManager] beginPaymentWithInvoice:sampleInvoice];
}

- (void)onPaymentEvent:(PPHTransactionManagerEvent *) event {
    // Card swiped
    if (event.eventType == ePPHTransactionType_CardDataReceived) {
        [[PayPalHereSDK sharedTransactionManager] processPaymentWithPaymentType:ePPHPaymentMethodSwipe withTransactionController:nil completionHandler:^(PPHTransactionResponse *response) {
            if (response.error) {
                NSLog(@"Transaction failed!");
            } else {
                NSLog(@"Transaction successful!");
                [self provideSignatureForTransaction:response.record];
                [self sendReceiptForTransaction:response.record];
            }
        }];
    }
}

- (void)provideSignatureForTransaction:(PPHTransactionRecord *)transaction {
    // More UI is required here to acquire a signature from the touch screen.
    [[PayPalHereSDK sharedTransactionManager] provideSignature:[UIImage imageNamed:@"myfakesignature"]
                                                forTransaction:transaction
                                             completionHandler:^(PPHError *error) {
                                                 if (error) {
                                                     NSLog(@"Providing signature failed, we should probably retry!");
                                                 } else {
                                                     NSLog(@"Providing signature successful.");
                                                 }
                                             }];
}

- (void)sendReceiptForTransaction:(PPHTransactionRecord *)transaction {
    // More UI is required here to get real receipt destination and type from the user.
    PPHReceiptDestination *receiptDestination = [PPHReceiptDestination new];
    receiptDestination.destinationAddress = @"captinfalconsfist@your.face";
    receiptDestination.isEmail = YES;
    
    [[PayPalHereSDK sharedTransactionManager] sendReceipt:transaction
                                              toRecipient:receiptDestination
                                        completionHandler:^(PPHError *error) {
                                            if (error) {
                                                NSLog(@"Sending receipt failed, we should probably retry!");
                                            } else {
                                                NSLog(@"Sending receipt successful.");
                                            }
                                        }];
}

@end
```

Comparitively when using the UI methods of the SDK you should do the following.

1. Implement a `PPHTransactionControllerDelegate`
2. Pass it to `beginPaymentUsingUIWithInvoice:transactionController:`
3. When appropriate (when the user interacts with the card reader in the sample code below) call `processPaymentUsingUIWithPaymentType:completionHandler:`

Sample code that implements these steps:

```objc
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
@interface MyTransactionViewController () <
PPHTransactionControllerDelegate
>

@end

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
@implementation MyTransactionViewController

- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewDidAppear:animated];
 
    PPHInvoice *sampleInvoice = [[PPHInvoice alloc] initWithItem:@"Falcon Punch!" forAmount:[PPHAmount amountWithString:@"1.00"]];
    [[PayPalHereSDK sharedTransactionManager] beginPaymentUsingUIWithInvoice:sampleInvoice
                                                       transactionController:self];
}


- (void)userDidSelectPaymentMethod:(PPHPaymentMethod) paymentOption {
    [[PayPalHereSDK sharedTransactionManager] processPaymentUsingUIWithPaymentType:paymentOption
                                                                 completionHandler:^(PPHTransactionResponse *response) {
                                                                     if (response.error) {
                                                                         NSLog(@"Transaction failed!");
                                                                     } else {
                                                                         NSLog(@"Transaction successful!");
                                                                     }
                                                                     
                                                                     [self.navigationController popToViewController:self animated:YES];
                                                                 }];
}

- (void)userDidSelectRefundMethod:(PPHPaymentMethod) refundOption {
    
}

- (UINavigationController *)getCurrentNavigationController {
    return self.navigationController;
}

@end
```

By using the UI methods you automatically get:

1. Card reader management (monitoring/activation/opening/data reception)
2. Alerts information the use of the state of the transaction
3. Capability to accept EMV payments and handling for all the edge cases that come with them
4. UI presented to acquire and send a signature if applicable
5. UI presented to acquire a receipt destination and send one if applicable


**Other Transaction Manager Changes**

- All previous beta EMV interaction methods have been removed. If you have an existing EMV integration with the PayPalHereSDK it is recommended that you start from scratch implementing the current methods.
- `shouldAppOverrideDefaultSignatureSetting` has been replaced by `requireSignatureWhenApplicable` and the `transactionRequiresSignatureForAmount:paymentMethod:` API to allow better control and insight to when signatures will be requested.
- `PPHTransactionControllerDelegate` no longer supports the `onPreAuthorizeForInvoice:withPreAuthJSON:` hook. It is recommended that you modify the invoice before calling the process payment API.
- `PPHTransactionControllerDelegate` no longer supports the `onPostAuthorize` hook. It is recommended that you provide a completion handler for the payments API you are using instead.



Card Reader Manager
===================

Many interfaces and behaviors have changed in Card Reader Manager to normalize interactions with the different reader types and enable detection of multiple readers.

The states of a card reader are defined as follows:
* Available - A potential reader of one of the monitored types has been detected.
* Connecting - We are in the process of acquiring more information about the reader.
* Connected - The reader is fully identified.
* Open - The reader is listening for card data

**API changes**
* `PPHCardReaderBasicInformation` and `PPHCardReaderMetadata` have been merged into a single class.
* `activateReader:` now behaves the same for all reader types, designating the reader as the only one capable of taking payments, and attempting to connect with it if it's not already connected.
* `openActiveReader` and `closeActiveReader` APIs are provided for granular control over when the card reader can receive card data. It is recommended to not leave a reader open when it's unneeded to conserve battery life.
* `availableDevices` has been renamed to `availableReaders`.
* `availableReaderOfType:`, `lastAvailableReaderOfType:` and `activeReader` APIs have been added to allow access of known reader metadata.


Constants
===================

* `PPHReaderType` and `PPHReaderTypeMask` have moved to "PPHReaderConstants.h"
