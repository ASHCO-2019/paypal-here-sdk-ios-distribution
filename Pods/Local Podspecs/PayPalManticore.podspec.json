  "summary": "A runtime to expose Javascript classes, logic and code to native components in OS X and iOS",
  "description": "paypal-manticore runs Javascript on OS X and iOS and allows interaction between native code and JS objects via \"shims\"\nthat manage type marshaling, callbacks (both directions) and objects/methods. It is most useful in cases where you want\n*broad* platform compatibility (all the way to WinXP) but do not want a cross platform UI solution (e.g. React Native).\nIn theory, Javascript written for Manticore will also work in React Native, but sometimes you want consolidated business\nlogic but not consolidated UI code.",
